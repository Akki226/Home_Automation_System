# Home_Automation_System

This project is a simulation of a smart home environment where appliances can be controlled through a smartphone. The simulation is built using PHP for the frontend and backend, an android application developed using Kotlin and Android Studio to control the appliances, and Firebase database to store the appliances status information.

# Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- Apache server
- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Firebase account

# Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Set up the Apache server and ensure that PHP is configured correctly.
- Import the project into Android Studio and build the android application.
- Create a Firebase account and set up a new project.
- Add the Firebase configuration file to the android application.
- Deploy the PHP code to your server and configure the database connection.
- Run the android application on an emulator or a physical device.
# Usage
- Open the android application and sign in to your account.
- The application will display the list of appliances that are connected to the simulation.
- You can turn on/off the appliances and monitor their status in real-time.
- The status of the appliances is stored in Firebase database and can be accessed from the web application.

Please note that this is a simulation and may not reflect the functionality of a real smart home.
